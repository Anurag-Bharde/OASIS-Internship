MERN stack pizza delivery app, complete with a Stripe payment gateway integration, MongoDB for data storage, user 
registration, and Redux for state management.

Using React, Node.js, and Express.js, I was able to create a dynamic user interface that fetches pizza details 
from the database and allows customers to place orders and make payments securely through Stripe.
The app also features user registration and account management, enabling customers to store their personal details
and delivery preferences for a seamless checkout experience..
